				An RPG in Slack? Thank GOD, right? Someone finally decided to make a USEFUL Slack

				ðŸ•£ Quick Play Sessions
			</h3>
			<p class="paragraph">
				There's no need to schedule dozens of people for a raid just to make progress, you
				do that enough already at work! It's easy to play for just a few minutes on your
				break or lunch and make meaningful progress.
				<br><br>
				Plus, the game is turn-based, so you can pick up where you left off at a moment's
				notice!

				ðŸ˜„ Actually Fun (I Know, Right?)
			</h3>
			<p class="paragraph">
				Sure, you're just clicking buttons and reading text, but there's tactical depth to
				the combat and strategic depth when you're considering how to grow your character.
				<br><br>
				Modern MMOs are frequently just a layer of graphics on top of text-based games
				anyway. We're just getting back to that old-school feel and fun.

				Play Your Way
			</h3>
			<p class="paragraph">
				Pick a Profession and your style of play changes. Maybe you want to focus on magic,
				or a solid defence, or all-out attacks? Well, try a Profession that appeals to you
				and go wild!
				<br><br>
				Plus, mastering a Profession grants permanent character bonuses that apply when you
				try out other ones!

				Dozens of Enemies
			</h3>
			<p class="paragraph">
				Every enemy is different! Some are stronger, some are weaker, and some have special
				attacks you have to watch out for and react to.
				<br><br>
				Learning which enemy has what tricks up their sleeve is a big component to playing
				optimally.

				An Epic and Fun Story
			</h3>
			<p class="paragraph">
				As you progress in the game, you'll uncover more and more of the story of the world,
				and of the two goddesses - Phaera and Obsidia - who rule over it.
				<br><br>
				Phaera grants you eternal life, while Obsidia wants to destroy all that lives, but
				is that really what's going on?
